**How Computer Works?**
Mainly a computer has two parts, Hardware and Software. The Hardware part is Circuits, Chips, Wires, Speakers etc. but what we don't see is the software, which is all of the computer's program code running on the machine. the hardware and the software interact one to another by CPU, Central Processing Unit. the CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. Inside a CPU it has smaller, simpler parts that handle a specific tasks. for example it has a circuit to do simple math, it has other circuit to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer. The CPU knows Which Circuits to use and When to use them ; the CPU receives a simple command that tells it which circuit to use to do a specific job. All of this simple commands can be represented by binary ONES and ZEROS or ON and OFF electrical signals. The binary commands are stored in Memory and CPU fetches and execute them in sequence one after the other. all computers has the following four things in common; they Take Input - Store Information - Proccess it and then - Output the results. Every Input and Output of a computer is a type of information which can be represented by ON or OFF electro signals.

**What are Transistors?**
Transistor is a semi-conductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow and acting as a switch or gate for them. As a switch, it can be in one of two distinct states ON or OFF to control the flow of electric signals through an electric circuit.

**Moore's Law**
Moore's Law is the idea that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers two increase every couple of years. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. Another tenet of Moore's law says that the growth of microprocessors is exponential. In 1965 Gordon E.Moore the co-founder of intel, made this observation that become known as Moore's law

Lambda Calculus

Lambda Calculus is a mathimatical model for understanding computation. Lambda Calculus consists three rules named; Variable, Abstraction and Application.
