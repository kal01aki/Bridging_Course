How Computer Works?
Mainly a computer has two parts, Hardware and Software. The Hardware part is Circuits, Chips, Wires, Speakers etc. but what we don't see is the software, which is all of the computer's program code running on the machine. the hardware and the software interact one to another by CPU, Central Processing Unit. the CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. Inside a CPU it has smaller, simpler parts that handle a specific tasks. for example it has a circuit to do simple math, it has other circuit to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer. The CPU knows Which Circuits to use and and When to use them ; the CPU receives a simple command that tells it which circuit to use to do a specific job. all of this simple commands can be represented by binary ONES and ZEROS or ON and OFF electrical signals. The binary commands are stored in Memory and CPU fetches and execute them in sequence one after the other.
